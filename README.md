### Hi there, I’m [Luis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisvidela/)! 👋

With over 20 years in software development, I specialize in **backend, blockchain, and AI-driven solutions**. My career has spanned distributed systems, microservices, and developer tooling, combining technical expertise with a passion for teaching and community building.

Currently, I work as a **Blockchain, Backend & AI Developer at Globant**, where I contribute to high-impact projects such as:

* Building **AI-powered research platforms** with multi-LLM integration (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Together AI), vector search (Qdrant, ChromaDB), and observability (OpenTelemetry, Traceloop).
* Modernizing enterprise platforms through **Node.js/TypeScript microservices** with PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, and AI automation.
* Designing **fan-engagement and loyalty platforms** using NFTs on Aptos, with wallet management via Fireblocks and NFT minting via Crossmint.

Beyond my role, I actively **mentor and teach Solidity and blockchain development**, having onboarded 100+ new developers across Latin America. I believe in the transformative power of blockchain and AI, and enjoy fostering innovation at the intersection of both.
