### Hi there, I’m [Luis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisvidela/)! 👋

I’m a **Senior AI Engineer & Blockchain Engineer** with **20+ years of experience in software development**, specializing in **AI systems, multi-agent LLM architectures, and production-grade blockchain platforms**.

My work focuses on **designing and evolving complex systems**: from **AI-powered research and intelligence platforms** to **tokenized Web3 infrastructures**, always with an emphasis on architecture, scalability, and real-world impact.

Currently, I work at **Globant**, where I contribute to high-impact initiatives such as:

- Architecting **AI-powered research and competitive intelligence platforms** using **multi-agent LLM orchestration**, RAG pipelines, and vector databases.
- Modernizing legacy enterprise systems into **cloud-native microservices** with **Node.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Docker**, often leveraging **AI-assisted development workflows**.
- Building **fan engagement and loyalty platforms** powered by **NFTs on Aptos**, integrating secure wallet infrastructure with **Fireblocks** and NFT minting via **Crossmint**.

Beyond industry work, I actively **contribute to open-source Web3 tooling** and **teach blockchain engineering and Solidity**, having onboarded **100+ developers** into professional Web3 development across Latin America.

I’m particularly interested in the intersection of **AI engineering, blockchain systems, and product strategy**, and how these technologies can be applied to build robust, long-lived platforms.
