### Hi there, Iâ€™m [Luis](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luisvidela/)! ðŸ‘‹

As an experienced software developer with over 20 years under my belt, I am deeply passionate about leveraging emerging technologies to address real-world challenges and transform them into viable business ventures. My expertise spans relational and non-relational databases, distributed architectures, web development, APIs, and microservices. Currently, I'm immersed in the world of Node.js and Solidity, crafting and deploying smart contracts for Ethereum-compatible networks. My conviction in the transformative potential of blockchain technology drives me. I'm not only an advocate but also an educator in this space. As a Solidity instructor, I've mentored numerous developers in blockchain techniques and have been at the forefront of community engagement, organizing events and courses in my city to further the blockchain cause.

Let's connect!
